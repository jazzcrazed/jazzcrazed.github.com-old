And I admittedly feel a bit of separation anxiety.

<span class="more"></span>

<p>
  I upgraded today from my
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_PEN_E-P1">Olympus E-P1</a> to the
  far more convenient
  <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1573">E-P3</a>.
  It&rsquo;s everything the E-P1 was, plus all that it should have been,
  including such basics as an orange focus assist light and a built in flash,
  and such advanced features as the ability to support an
  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/IOMVF2.html">electronic viewfinder</a> and
  a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-MCG-2-BLK-Camera-Black/dp/B005LT1XP6">swappable hand grip</a>.
  It will make my shooting life faster and easier, and I&rsquo;m excited about
  the countless brain cells that will be saved going forward.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps best of all, I got the near-new body with a gorgeous leather case for
  $425 via Craigslist &mdash; significantly cheaper than retail, and even
  undercutting the current average on Ebay, if you count shipping.

    affixed, along with a Metz 36 AF-4 Mecablitz flash.

<p>
  And yet, I&rsquo;m feeling a little bittersweet about it. Not because of the
  idea of using the E-P3, but because of the idea of retiring my E-P1. I got the
  E-P1 two winters ago, also used (far more used, in fact), and have grown as
  an amateur wannabe-photographer significantly through that time. Though I
  never used every feature of the camera, what I did use has become programmed
  reflex in my mind and hands. I just <em>know</em> what to do with the camera,
  and I <em>know</em> what it will give me in return, and that level of comfort
  is surprisingly profound. In the few dozen minutes I&rsquo;ve spent so far
  with the E-P3, I feel like I&rsquo;m using someone else&rsquo;s machine; the
  shot I took of it above using the E-P1 (with my workhorse
  <a href="http://panasonic.net/avc/lumix/systemcamera/gms/lens/g_20.html">
    Panasonic 20mm f1.7</a>) felt like returning home after a tiring business
  trip.
</p>

<p>
  More than that, the E-P1 has gone places, and recorded some of my fiance&#233;&rsquo;s
  and my most important moments: my fiance&#233;&rsquo;s mom visiting,
  friend&rsquo;s weddings, Christmases, Thanksgivings, hiking trips, a vacation
  in Thailand, our cats&hellip; Thinking back, I don&rsquo;t wish I had an E-P3,
  or any other &ldquo;better&rdquo; camera, that whole time. I&rsquo;m thankful
  I had my E-P1 in my hands, the most trustworthy camera I&rsquo;ve used yet.
  While the comfort level issue with the E-P3 is probably just a matter of
  software, and will be learned, I won&rsquo;t soon forget all the moments the
  E-P1 has captured.

<p>
  For sure, this sentimentality for a piece of consumer electronics is a
  decidedly First World Problem, and you won&rsquo;t catch me whining after this
  about the E-P3. I will eventually be far faster at the E-P3 than I ever could
  have been with the E-P1, and taking much better photos. I&rsquo;ve been pining
  for a replacement to the E-P1 for maybe half a year now, since probably just
  before the E-P3 launched. I use an array of manual lenses, and it&rsquo;s
  annoying to use the rear LCD on the E-P1 to manually focus. The E-P3 can take
  a viewfinder that makes that process much easier, and it even boasts so high
  resolution of a rear LCD that I can nail focus easily without magnification.
  The E-P1 lacks a focus assist lamp, making autofocusing in low light
  challenging. The E-P3 not only has the assist lamp, but also a built-in flash.
</p>

<p>
  But despite my pining, and near-daily browsing of
  <a href="http://43rumors.com">new micro 4/3rds developments</a>, I never
  anticipated <em>missing</em> the E-P1. I <em>never</em> feel that way about
  electronics. I guess sometimes photography isn&rsquo;t just about the photos.
</p>

<p>Thanks for the thousands of shots, Olympus E-P1.</p>

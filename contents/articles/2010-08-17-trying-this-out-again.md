I'm going to give blogging a shot again. I used to do this quite a bit, but that was about seven years ago. I lost my appetite for it not long after that, out of some combination of laziness and general lack of writing ability. I'm thinking by now I've gotten over the lazy bit.

<span class="more"></span>

<p>
  My older blog I used to call my "everything website" -- describing its handy
  utility as a general dumping grounds for my brain. After nearly a decade, it
  turns out I've still got stuff to dump somewhere, and it wouldn't be fair lump
  it all on my beautiful and wonderful fianceé, whose brain neither runs regular
  backups nor has a handy search function.
</p>

<p>
  Actually, this site doesn't have a handy search function, either, (and actually
  my fianceé does have strikingly good memory). And that's the next reason I put
  this up -- to exercise my Web development and design chops which for the past
  two years have been running the hamster tubes of my
  <a href="http://www.theknot.com">full-time job</a> with little room to stretch.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, this is where you'll get to see me do a lot of things that I
  haven't done in quite a while, or haven't quite tried at all in the past. So
  mind my stumbling!

I just got a springbar tool from Amazon, and I think it&rsquo;s the best nine bucks
I&rsquo;ve spent in a while. Why? Because it lets me do this:

  That’s a light-brown nylon NATO strap on the very same Parnis pilot watch that
  I reviewed a while back. If you’ll remember (or as you’ll see, if you never
  knew to begin with and proceed to
  <a href="/2012/04/23/parnis-manual-wind-watches">read my review of it</a>),
  one of my least favorite things about the watch was the strap. It so happens
  that’s exceedingly easy to remedy, thanks to this cheap tool.
</p>

<p>
  Crucially for me, it’s allowed me to do this:
</p>

<p>
  That’s the ruddy brown strap from my broken Garton pilot, which I think is an
  amazing match for this watch. The reddish color plays well with the tiny red
  “60” in the seconds sub-dial, and the stainless steel rivets make it look even
  more classic -- not to mention that it’s a softer and more comfortable strap
  than the stiff affair that came with the Parnis originally.

  But most importantly, I’ve increased the versatility of my watch with this
  tool. I can dress it up with leather, or make it more breathable with a nylon
  or canvas. And I never have to worry about the strap not matching my belt and
  shoes (yes...I do worry about that a little).

  Instructions abound on Youtube</a> on using springbar tools, but honestly
  there’s not much to figure out, anyway. Just don’t store it where you’d be
  reaching for it blindly; some of the tips are pin-sharp.

  By the way&hellip;on the topic of straps, the aforementioned NATO strap, from
  a company called Clockwork Synergy, is great,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_watches?_encoding=UTF8&node=377110011&field-brandtextbin=Clockwork%20Synergy%2C%20LLC">
    and comes in more colors than the rainbow</a>. I was concerned that I&rsquo;d
  have to
  <a href="http://www.pmwf.com/Watches/WatchSchool/WS 13 How to add additional holes to Nylon straps/WS 13 How to make nice additional holes into Nylon straps.htm">
    melt holes in it</a> because these straps are notoriously long (probably
  to accommodate James Bond&rsquo;s massive Soviet-choking wrists), but &mdash;
  unlike its leather cousins &mdash; this one didn&rsquo;t need any modification.
  I recommend them.

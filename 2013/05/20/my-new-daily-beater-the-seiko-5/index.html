<p>My <a href="/2012/04/23/parnis-manual-wind-watches">Parnis pilot watch</a>,
while running strong and looking great for a year, at 44mm was starting to feel
large on the wrist. My Hamilton at 42mm was not much better — and
thanks to its complicated automatic movement was thicker and heavier. I also
missed having a watch, like my old busted Garton, that would be readable for a
couple of hours in a dark movie theater — which neither of the
above could&nbsp;accomplish.</p>

<p>The “5” is a line of workhorse automatics by Japanese
horological titan, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko">Seiko</a>, that
meet five criteria: unbreakable mainspring, shock resistance,
water resistance, automatic movement, and a day/date complication (according
to the <a href="http://forums.watchuseek.com/f281/seiko-branding-dictionary-209014.html">Seiko Branding Dictionary</a>
on <a href="http://watchuseek.com/">WatchUSeek</a>. They also frequently meet one
more: extremely long-lasting visible glow-in-the-dark lume. And a
seventh criteria: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+5+site%3Aamazon.com&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US505&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=seiko+5+site%3Aamazon.com&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57.2809j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=seiko+5&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US505&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0I2aUb7BF8Lv0gG15IDAAg&amp;ved=0CC4Qsxg&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46751780,d.dmg&amp;fp=6f14e6494ed75bed&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=828">often costing under $100</a>. It’s a wonder I never happened
on these when I first sought a mechanical&nbsp;watch.</p>

<p>I made a decent excuse to get my first Seiko 5: I needed a good dress watch for
the occasional wedding. It had to sport a white or silver dial, and look good
with a black leather strap. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051IYQ06/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"><span class="caps">SNKL29</span></a>
at $64 was a bargain match. I loved the watch so much that I got it a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0PTO6/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">brown leather strap</a>
for near-daily use. It really sort of blew me away with how much watch it was
for the money. Just for the terrific day <em>and</em> date display, and perfect 38mm
size, I’d be happy. But it sports a beautiful dial with lovely and classic
printed Roman numerals around a simple track of second markings that also sport
shockingly strong dot lume at the hours. The plongeur-style hands are
also exceedingly readable through the night. Literally — I could
still read the time in the darkness of extremely early morning (the few
times I was&nbsp;awake).</p>
<figure class="">          <div class="curledShadow"><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5880267859561767330?pid=5880267859561767330&amp;oid=101625155591132408533"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0kskuCcKyI4/UZrodplTYaI/AAAAAAAANSk/Pfqne558zgA/w947-h710-no/P5170134.jpg" alt="The Seiko SNKL07 and SNKL29.

The 29 has an 18mm lug width, while the 07 has a 20mm.</figcaption></figure>
<p>One important thing to note is that the <span class="caps">SNKL29</span> sports an 18mm lug width
— <em>not</em> the 19mm specified on its Amazon page. This was annoying
when I got my 19mm straps, as I had to shave a bit off of them to fit.
It’s also got a silver dial — not white. I actually think
white would feel dressier, but the silver has a nice sheen, and
there’s a kind of pinstripe guilloche-like effect inside the
seconds&nbsp;track.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-daily-beater-in-the-snkl07">The Perfect Daily Beater in the&nbsp;<span class="caps">SNKL07</span></h2>
<p>Recently, I came across <a href="http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t363/kmusky68/snkl09/DSCN02172.jpg">this photo of the <span class="caps">SNKL09</span></a>
in <a href="http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/show-off-your-seiko-5-a-702513.html">this addictive thread</a>,
and fell in love. The big hour markers, the black dial mated with an army-green
canvas strap, the fire-red second hand&hellip; I knew my days with just
one Seiko were&nbsp;numbered.</p>
<p>I’d placed both the 09 and its Navy sibling, the <span class="caps">SNKL07</span>, into my Amazon
wishlist. The 07 dipped below $65 a few weeks ago, and I took the&nbsp;bait.</p>
<figure class="right">          <div class="curledShadow"><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879751971381925506?pid=5879751971381925506&amp;oid=101625155591132408533"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jJ9-XLUKyGw/UZkTRAWfVoI/AAAAAAAANQg/8iVZixy8q_A/w949-h712-no/P5170136.jpg?align=right" alt="The SNKL29 has a smaller, inset crown, while the SNKL07&apos;s is sized and placed more traditionally at 3-o-clock."></a></div><figcaption>The <span class="caps">SNKL29</span> has a smaller, inset crown, while the SNKL07&#8217;s is sized and placed more traditionally at 3-o-clock.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than the obvious dial color difference, the 07 has a white instead
of red second-hand, and a white background to the day/date. This
actually makes it feel more formal in my mind than the military-like 09.
Compared to the dressier silver-faced 29, it’s around the same diameter,
but the crown is larger and placed more traditionally at the 3-o-clock.
On the 29, the tiny inset crown helps maintain a clean look on a dressy
watch, though it can be hard to access; on the 07, it’s more practically
sized and positioned for a much more general-use&nbsp;watch.</p>
<figure class="">          <div class="curledShadow"><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752192510011794?pid=5879752192510011794&amp;oid=101625155591132408533"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pNk3U2Za5eo/UZkTd4HiKZI/AAAAAAAANRI/68eGlbfrBl0/w947-h710-no/P5180148.jpg" alt="The SNKL07 on an olive nylon strap."></a></div><figcaption>The <span class="caps">SNKL07</span> on an olive nylon strap.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite not feeling as military as its black-dialed red-handed 09
brother, the 07 is still gorgeous. It looks good on my <a href="/2013/05/20/my-new-daily-beater-the-seiko-5/{%%20post_url%202012-07-29-nato-style-straps-rock%20%}">olive-green <span class="caps">NATO</span>
strap</a>, but like my 
Hamilton this deep navy watch looks great with light browns. With a 20mm lug
width, it can accommodate all of my existing straps, and I found its
ultimate pairing with my thick caramel-colored <span class="caps">NATO</span> leather strap.
It’s a bit weathered of a strap after accommodating the
harsh-edged 44mm Parnis for so long, but I’ve come to enjoy the
added texture. It’s literally become pretty much my daily&nbsp;watch.</p>

<figure class="right">          <div class="curledShadow"><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752144617734370?pid=5879752144617734370&amp;oid=101625155591132408533"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qMDI8gN7pKU/UZkTbFtIAOI/AAAAAAAANRA/LIJusLbUQrU/w1198-h898-no/P5170139.jpg?align=right" alt="38mm is clearly smaller than 44. The Parnis is slightly skinnier, though."></a></div><figcaption>38mm is clearly smaller than 44. The Parnis is slightly skinnier, though.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both Seikos are perfectly sized at around 38mm in diameter, and
relatively narrow and light. They aren’t quite as skinny as my
Parnis, which is understandable as an automatic movement is typically
thicker than a manual-wind (also, undoubtedly the water resistance adds
girth thanks to things like gaskets), but they’re not thick
either, and are obviously narrower in diameter and look more proportional
on my skinny&nbsp;wrists.</p>
<p>The movement in both is, like nearly all Seiko 5s, the <a href="https://watchotaku.atlassian.net/wiki/display/swr/Seiko+7S26">7S26</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an automatic movement that is the result of decades of
polish and streamlining by Seiko to the point where they could churn
these out blind. It’s undecorated and purely utilitarian —
the print on the back claims 21 jewels, but none are really visible
through the transparent casebacks on my 07 or 29. Like all mechanical
watches, it’s not going to be as accurate as a quartz. But I
realize after years on mechanical watches that I don’t really
notice or care about the&nbsp;inaccuracy.</p>
<figure class="">          <div class="curledShadow"><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752038790105106?pid=5879752038790105106&amp;oid=101625155591132408533"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N6PuCDTggO4/UZkTU7d2iBI/AAAAAAAANQo/4-BQCcSp6vw/w946-h710-no/P5170137.jpg" alt="Seiko&apos;s workhorse automatic movement: the 7S26."></a></div><figcaption>Seiko&#8217;s workhorse automatic movement: the 7S26.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The day/date function on both watches is about as good as it gets. First
off, you get the <em>day</em>, while most watches are content with just the
date. Who cares that I usually always remember the day of the week?
There are less useful complications out in the watch world.
There’s also the option of Spanish rather than English days. Also,
“<span class="caps">SAT</span>” takes on a nice baby blue, while “SUN” is a
striking&nbsp;red.</p>
<p>And the lume really deserves reiteration. I’m spoiled for
watch lume thanks to these Seikos, to the point that the lume on my other
watches make little sense in comparison. I wasn’t kidding that
these are readable after hours in the dark. And I don’t explicitly
“charge” these watches — this is just with the general office
light and sunlight they receive during a rather average (I think)&nbsp;workday.</p>

<h2 id="other-5s-hellip-">Other&nbsp;5s&hellip;</h2>
<p>It’ll be hard to make the 07 my last Seiko. It might swing too closely to
the 09 (I’d sooner just have the second hand replaced for a red one than
also nab the 9). But at least half a dozen Seiko 5s from the amazing
<a href="http://forums.watchuseek.com/f281/seiko-branding-dictionary-209014.html">WatchUSeek thread</a>
have made it to my wishlist or bookmarks. Like the sporty <a href="http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/show-off-your-seiko-5-a-702513-4.html#post5135874"><span class="caps">SNKK27K1</span></a>,
which looks especially great on tan leather. Or the <a href="http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/show-off-your-seiko-5-a-702513-9.html#post5270388"><span class="caps">SNZJ63</span></a>.

seems hard to&nbsp;beat.</p>

the Seiko 5 series in&nbsp;general.</p>
